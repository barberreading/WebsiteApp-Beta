# Security Incident Response Procedures

## Overview
This document outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents in the WebsiteApp application.

## Incident Classification

### Critical (P0)
- Data breach or unauthorized access to sensitive data
- Complete system compromise
- Active ongoing attack with significant impact
- Exposure of authentication credentials

### High (P1)
- Brute force attacks detected
- SQL injection or XSS attempts
- Unauthorized privilege escalation
- Suspicious admin account activity

### Medium (P2)
- Rate limiting violations
- Failed authentication attempts above threshold
- Suspicious user behavior patterns
- Minor security policy violations

### Low (P3)
- Security configuration warnings
- Non-critical security log anomalies
- Routine security maintenance items

## Incident Response Team

### Primary Contacts
- **Incident Commander**: [Your Name] - [Email] - [Phone]
- **Technical Lead**: [Tech Lead Name] - [Email] - [Phone]
- **Security Officer**: [Security Officer] - [Email] - [Phone]
- **Communications Lead**: [Comms Lead] - [Email] - [Phone]

### Escalation Matrix
1. **Developer/On-call** → **Technical Lead** (within 15 minutes)
2. **Technical Lead** → **Incident Commander** (within 30 minutes)
3. **Incident Commander** → **Management** (within 1 hour for P0/P1)

## Response Procedures

### Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)

#### For Critical Incidents (P0)
1. **STOP THE BREACH**
   - Isolate affected systems immediately
   - Block suspicious IP addresses
   - Disable compromised user accounts
   - Take affected services offline if necessary

2. **Alert the Team**
   ```bash
   # Emergency contact script
   node scripts/emergency-alert.js --incident="DATA_BREACH" --severity="CRITICAL"
   ```

3. **Preserve Evidence**
   - Capture system logs
   - Take memory dumps if needed
   - Document all actions taken

#### For High Incidents (P1)
1. **Assess the Threat**
   - Review security monitoring alerts
   - Check audit logs for patterns
   - Identify affected systems/users

2. **Implement Immediate Protections**
   - Enable additional rate limiting
   - Block suspicious IPs
   - Increase monitoring sensitivity

### Investigation Phase (15 minutes - 2 hours)

#### Evidence Collection
1. **System Logs**
   ```bash
   # Collect application logs
   tail -n 1000 /var/log/websiteapp/app.log > incident-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
   
   # Collect security logs
   tail -n 1000 /var/log/websiteapp/security.log > security-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
   
   # Collect audit logs
   tail -n 1000 /var/log/websiteapp/audit.log > audit-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
   ```

2. **Database Analysis**
   ```javascript
   // Check for unauthorized data access
   db.auditLogs.find({
     timestamp: { $gte: new Date(Date.now() - 24*60*60*1000) },
     riskLevel: { $in: ['HIGH', 'CRITICAL'] }
   }).sort({ timestamp: -1 });
   ```

3. **Network Analysis**
   - Review firewall logs
   - Check for unusual traffic patterns
   - Analyze connection logs

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Timeline Reconstruction**
   - Map out sequence of events
   - Identify initial attack vector
   - Document progression of incident

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Determine data affected
   - Identify compromised accounts
   - Assess system integrity

### Containment and Eradication (2-24 hours)

#### Containment Strategies
1. **Network Isolation**
   ```bash
   # Block malicious IPs
   iptables -A INPUT -s [MALICIOUS_IP] -j DROP
   
   # Limit connections
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m limit --limit 25/minute --limit-burst 100 -j ACCEPT
   ```

2. **Account Security**
   ```javascript
   // Disable compromised accounts
   await User.updateMany(
     { _id: { $in: compromisedUserIds } },
     { $set: { isActive: false, securityLocked: true } }
   );
   
   // Force password reset for affected users
   await User.updateMany(
     { _id: { $in: affectedUserIds } },
     { $set: { forcePasswordReset: true } }
   );
   ```

3. **System Hardening**
   - Apply security patches
   - Update security configurations
   - Strengthen access controls

#### Eradication Steps
1. **Remove Malicious Code**
   - Scan for backdoors
   - Remove unauthorized files
   - Clean infected systems

2. **Close Attack Vectors**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Update security rules
   - Implement additional controls

### Recovery Phase (24-72 hours)

#### System Restoration
1. **Gradual Service Restoration**
   ```bash
   # Restore services one by one
   systemctl start websiteapp-backend
   systemctl start websiteapp-frontend
   systemctl start nginx
   ```

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   ```javascript
   // Increase monitoring sensitivity
   const enhancedMonitoring = {
     FAILED_LOGINS_PER_IP: 3, // Reduced from 5
     REQUESTS_PER_IP: 50,      // Reduced from 100
     SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS_THRESHOLD: 2 // Reduced from 3
   };
   ```

3. **User Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Provide security recommendations
   - Offer support resources

#### Validation
1. **Security Testing**
   - Vulnerability scans
   - Penetration testing
   - Security configuration review

2. **Monitoring Verification**
   - Test alert systems
   - Verify log collection
   - Confirm backup integrity

### Post-Incident Activities (72+ hours)

#### Documentation
1. **Incident Report**
   - Timeline of events
   - Root cause analysis
   - Impact assessment
   - Response actions taken

2. **Lessons Learned**
   - What worked well
   - Areas for improvement
   - Process updates needed

#### Process Improvement
1. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement additional controls
   - Update security policies
   - Enhance monitoring rules

2. **Training Updates**
   - Update incident response training
   - Conduct tabletop exercises
