## üî¥ CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials in Environment File
**Severity:** Critical  
**File:** `backend/.env`  
**Risk:** Complete system compromise

**Issue:**
- MongoDB Atlas connection string contains hardcoded username/password
- Email service password stored in plaintext
- Credentials visible in version control

```env
MONGO_URI_ATLAS=mongodb+srv://barbe:Barbe123@cluster0.mongodb.net/websiteapp
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password_here
```

**Impact:** 
- Full database access for attackers
- Email system compromise
- Potential data exfiltration

**Recommendation:**
- Move all credentials to secure environment variables
- Use MongoDB Atlas IP whitelisting
- Implement credential rotation policy
- Remove .env from version control

### 2. Frontend Dependency Vulnerabilities
**Severity:** Critical  
**Location:** Frontend dependencies  
**Risk:** XSS, Code execution, Data theft

**Vulnerabilities Found:**
- 10 total vulnerabilities (4 moderate, 6 high)
- `nth-check` ReDoS vulnerability
- `postcss` line return parsing error
- `webpack-dev-server` source code exposure
- `svgo` CSS selector vulnerabilities

**Impact:**
- Cross-site scripting attacks
- Source code theft
- Client-side code execution

**Recommendation:**
- Run `npm audit fix` immediately
- Update all vulnerable packages
- Implement automated dependency scanning

### 3. Excessive Console Logging with Sensitive Data
**Severity:** Critical  
**Location:** Throughout codebase  
**Risk:** Information disclosure

**Issues:**
- 200+ console.log statements across codebase
- Passwords, tokens, and user data logged
- Database connection strings exposed in logs
- Error details leaked in production

**Examples:**
```javascript
// In test files - passwords logged
console.log(`Attempting login with password: ${password}`);

// Database credentials exposed
console.log('Connected to:', connectionString);

// User data in logs
console.log('User data:', JSON.stringify(user, null, 2));
```

**Recommendation:**
- Remove all console.log statements from production code
- Implement structured logging with Winston
- Sanitize log outputs
- Use log levels appropriately

---

## üü† HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES

### 4. Weak JWT Secret Management
**Severity:** High  
**File:** `backend/.env`

**Issue:**
- JWT secret relies on environment variable that may not be set
- No fallback or validation for JWT secret strength

**Recommendation:**
- Generate cryptographically strong JWT secrets (256-bit minimum)
- Implement secret rotation mechanism
- Validate secret strength on startup

### 5. Insufficient Input Validation
**Severity:** High  
**Files:** Various API endpoints

**Issues:**
- File upload endpoints lack proper validation
- Image upload accepts base64 without size/type limits
- Some endpoints missing rate limiting

**Recommendation:**
- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Add file type and size restrictions
- Validate all user inputs server-side

### 6. Database Connection Security
**Severity:** High  
**File:** `server.js`

**Issues:**
- Multiple connection strings with different security levels
- Fallback to less secure local MongoDB
- Connection pooling not optimally configured

**Recommendation:**
- Use only secure, encrypted connections
- Implement connection string validation
- Configure proper connection pooling

### 7. Error Information Disclosure
**Severity:** High  
**File:** `middleware/errorHandler.js`

**Issue:**
- Stack traces exposed in development mode
- Detailed error messages may leak system information

**Recommendation:**
- Sanitize all error responses
- Log detailed errors server-side only
- Implement generic error messages for clients

---

## üü° MEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES

### 8. CORS Configuration
**Severity:** Medium  
**File:** `server.js`

**Current Config:**
```javascript
cors({
  origin: ['http://localhost:3001', 'http://localhost:3002'],
  credentials: true
})
```

**Issues:**
- Hardcoded origins for development
- No production CORS configuration

**Recommendation:**
- Environment-specific CORS configuration
- Restrict origins in production

### 9. Rate Limiting Gaps
**Severity:** Medium  
**Files:** Various route files

**Issues:**
- Some endpoints lack specific rate limiting
- File upload endpoints need stricter limits

**Recommendation:**
- Apply endpoint-specific rate limiting
- Implement progressive rate limiting

### 10. Session Management
**Severity:** Medium  
**File:** `middleware/auth.js`

**Issues:**
- Token blacklisting implementation could be improved
- No session timeout warnings

**Recommendation:**
- Implement sliding session expiration
- Add session timeout warnings

### 11. File Upload Security
**Severity:** Medium  
**Files:** Image upload modules

**Issues:**
- Base64 image uploads without proper validation
- No file size limits enforced
- Missing file type validation

**Recommendation:**
- Implement proper file validation
- Add virus scanning for uploads
- Limit file sizes and types

### 12. Logging Configuration
**Severity:** Medium  
**File:** `modules/logging/logging.services.js`

**Issues:**
- Basic log rotation (1MB limit)
- No log retention policy
- Missing structured logging

**Recommendation:**
- Implement comprehensive log management
- Add log retention policies
- Use structured logging formats

### 13. Monitoring and Alerting
**Severity:** Medium  
**File:** `services/errorMonitoringService.js`

**Issues:**
- Basic error monitoring implementation
- No security event alerting
- Limited intrusion detection

**Recommendation:**
- Implement security event monitoring
- Add real-time alerting for suspicious activities
- Integrate with SIEM solutions
