# Security Improvements - Hardcoded Password Removal

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements made to remove hardcoded passwords from the application, particularly for Andrew Barber's admin account and other administrative scripts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Passwords
The following files have been updated to remove hardcoded passwords:

- `scripts/restore_complete_booking_keys.js`
- `scripts/restore_keys_api_only.js`
- `scripts/remove_remaining_duplicates.js`
- `scripts/createSuperuser.js`
- `scripts/simple_clients_test.js`
- `scripts/quick_test.js`
- `scripts/restore_original_data.js`

### 2. Environment Variable Implementation
All scripts now use environment variables for authentication:

- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Admin user email (defaults to andrew@everythingchildcareagency.co.uk)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Admin user password (required, no default)

### 3. Security Enhancements
- Added proper error handling for missing credentials
- Removed fallback password attempts
- Added validation for required environment variables
- Updated .env.example with admin credential documentation

## Usage Instructions

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Set the admin credentials in your `.env` file:
   ```
   ADMIN_EMAIL=andrew@everythingchildcareagency.co.uk
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
   ```

### Running Scripts Securely

Before running any administrative scripts, ensure:

1. The `.env` file contains the correct `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
2. The admin user exists in the database
3. The backend server is running on the correct port

### Example Script Execution
```bash
# Make sure environment variables are set
node scripts/restore_complete_booking_keys.js
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit passwords to version control**
2. **Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts**
3. **Regularly rotate admin passwords**
4. **Keep .env files out of version control** (already in .gitignore)
5. **Use different passwords for different environments**

## Remaining Security Considerations

While the main hardcoded passwords for Andrew Barber have been removed, consider reviewing:

1. Test files that may contain hardcoded test passwords
2. Sample data scripts that create users with default passwords
3. Password reset functionality for additional security measures

## Emergency Access

If you lose access to the admin account:

1. Use the `createSuperuser.js` script to create a new admin user
2. Set appropriate environment variables before running
3. Remove or disable the old admin account if compromised

**Important**: This security update requires all team members to update their local `.env` files with the correct admin credentials before running any maintenance scripts.
